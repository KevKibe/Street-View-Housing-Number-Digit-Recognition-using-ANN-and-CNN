# Street-View-Housing-Number-Digit-Recognition-using-ANN-and-CNN
# Objective
A project to  build a feed-forward neural network model and convolution neural network model that can recognize the digits in the images and compare the accuracy.
# Dataset
Here, we will use a subset of the original data to save some computation time. The dataset is provided as a .h5 file. The basic preprocessing steps have been applied on the dataset.<br>
The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve the map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.<br>
